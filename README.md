# My Flutter Project Structure

This repository serves as the foundation for my Flutter project, meticulously crafted using the Flutter Clean Architecture. This architectural choice ensures a standardized, clean, and maintainable structure, placing a strong emphasis on testability and scalability.

## Project Structure Overview

The project is meticulously organized into the following key directories:

- **lib**: This directory holds the Dart source code for the Flutter application.
  - **core**: Home to shared utilities, extensions, and common functionalities utilized across various layers.
  - **features**: Contains feature-specific folders, each encapsulating:
    - **presentation**: Encompasses the UI layer, housing screens, widgets, and presenters.
    - **domain**: Represents the domain layer, encapsulating the business logic and use cases.
    - **data**: Manages the data layer, handling interactions with external data sources.

- **test**: This directory comprehensively covers all unit and widget tests, ensuring the reliability of the application.

# Why Flutter Clean Architecture?

The decision to embrace Flutter Clean Architecture is underpinned by several compelling reasons:

- **Maintainability**: The architecture promotes a modular and organized codebase, simplifying maintenance and enhancement tasks.

- **Testability**: Facilitating unit testing across different layers ensures the application's robustness and reliability.

- **Scalability**: Clean Architecture paves the way for seamless project scalability by keeping concerns separated and dependencies well-defined.

- **Readability**: The structure significantly enhances code readability, making it more accessible for developers to comprehend and contribute to the project.
